Python 3 scripts. Serial implementation of Conformational Space Annealing (CSA) global optimization method.

This major rewrite allows for the implementation of new Hamiltonian and objective functions using
the Spin class as template.

A random generator class was implemented to facilitate future parallel implementation.

The Spin class reproduces results from:
Seung-Yeon Kim, Sung Jong Lee, and Jooyoung Lee, Ground-state energy and energy landscape of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, 
Phys.Rev.B, Vol. 76, 184412-1 - 184412-7 (2007).

Open Source implementation of CSA as described by and references within:
